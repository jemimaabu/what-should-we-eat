Created after a 10 minute conversation with Adesuwa (@littlezigy) that went something like this:

Me: So what do you want to eat?

Her: Cereal?

Me: Meh, nope.

Her: Then what?

Me: Hmm... plantain and egg?

Her: What about bread and egg?

Me: Or we could do indomie?

Her: Pancakes!

Me: There's too many choices!

Her: Yeah, we should write all the choices down, put it in a bucket and just pick one at random.

Me: Or we could build something that does that.

5 minutes later, the first draft of What Should We Eat was built.

**Sidenote:** We ate cereal.
